# ICX binding/NUMA results


## P0 validated — 182588070.gadi-pbs

PBS F / Exit0; script_exit_rc0 and unique PASS. SPR host0381,104CPU,23seconds walltime,actual1.33SU. Default104 ranks each allowed13 physicalcores in one NUMA domain; core104 distinct physicalcores, each within the same rank's default CPU mask. Independent local helper validation passes; can_run_binding=true. Optional fill/span104-rank placement launches pass too.

Both MPI runtime ranks report UCP /usr/lib64/libucp.so.0 version1.21.0 with Allreduce sum1. HCOLL selected in dual-rank collective receipt; UCC unavailable/disqualified. These observations do not establish actual104-rank solver collective selection or memory-page placement. Modules remain ucx1.18.1/ucc1.4.4; module names alone do not identify the loaded library.

Archived444 original files with remote/local SHA agreement plus captured qstat-xf.txt in planning/evidence/gadi-pbs-script-snapshot/logs/182588070.gadi-pbs/. First short SCP pull hit a90second local transfer timeout while making progress; existing partial files were preserved and checked. Independent folder pulls into fresh staging directories with bounded420second transfer deadlines completed; this was not an authentication or PBS failure, and no job was retried. No raw file overwritten. No OpenFOAM solve, Cd or seconds/step in this preflight.

Next authorized action: once archive/result commit is synchronized and remote script hashes and absent unique AB stdout checked, submit AB once with BIND_ORDER=ab,BIND_PREFLIGHT_JOB=182588070.gadi-pbs and explicit _ab stdout. BA remains gated on AB results. Script unchanged from reviewed commit2b71932.

Numerical probe outcome is recorded in metrics.csv. Timing and Cd fields remain empty because no solver ran.
